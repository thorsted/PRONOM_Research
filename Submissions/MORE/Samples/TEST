.HEAD 0 +  Exporting Outlines from GrandView for use in Time Line

	
This version of GrandView includes a new export format 
for Time Line outlines.  When you choose this format, 
GrandView creates a file that Time Line can read with 
its Outline Importer utility.  GrandView only exports 
the outline; category information is not included. 	
	
To export an outline to Time Line follow these steps:	

.HEAD 1 +  Exporting the outline from GrandView


.HEAD 2 -  Open the GrandView outline you want to export to Time 
Line.
.HEAD 2 -  Select Export from the File Menu by pressing F10 F E.
.HEAD 2 -  Choose the Time Line Outline format (use the arrow 
keys to move the cursor to the Time Line Outline 
option).
.HEAD 2 -  Select the Export button by pressing the tab key 
followed by the return key.  GrandView will display 
the File Listing dialog box.
.HEAD 2 -  Select the Time Line Data sub-directory from the File 
Listing dialog box (use the directory button if 
necessary).
.HEAD 2 -  Enter an eight character name for the file.  You do 
not need to give it an extension; GrandView 
automatically adds a .TXT extension.
.HEAD 2 -  Choose the OK button by pressing return.


.HEAD 1 +  Importing the outline into Time Line


.HEAD 2 -  Open Time Line
.HEAD 2 -  Import the outline by choosing File Import Outline 
from the Time Line menu (F I O).
.HEAD 2 -  Select the disk option (D)
.HEAD 2 -  The file you created in GrandView will be listed in 
the Time Line directory.  To select the file, use 
Time Line's Quick Pick feature: type as much of the 
filename as necessary for the cursor to highlight it. 
 After the file name is selected, press return.	

.HEAD 1 +  Other Notes


.HEAD 2 -  Only outline information is exported; no category 
information is included.
.HEAD 2 -  Time Line's outline importer recognizes special codes 
for resources, durations, costs, etc.  These codes 
can be imbedded directly into your GrandView outline. 
 When you import an outline with codes into Time Line, 
Time Line will translate the codes into the 
appropriate components of the schedule; the codes 
will not appear in the task outline.  For more 
information on these codes and how they can be used, 
please refer to the Time Line documentation.
